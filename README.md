# Prodigy Data Science Internship Task 3

This repository contains the code for Task 3 of the Prodigy Data Science Internship. Task 3 involves building and evaluating decision tree classifiers using the bank marketing dataset. 

## Task Description
"Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository."

## Dataset
The dataset used for this task is the bank marketing dataset (`bank-full.csv`), which contains information about marketing campaigns for a banking institution. It includes features such as age, job, marital status, education, housing loan status, personal loan status, and whether the client subscribed to a term deposit.

## Code Overview
- **Importing Libraries:** Importing necessary libraries including Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- **Loading Dataset:** Loading the bank marketing dataset using Pandas.
- **Data Cleaning:** Checking for missing values and handling duplicate records.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Exploring the distribution of various features in the dataset using histograms and count plots.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Encoding categorical variables and splitting the dataset into independent and dependent variables.
- **Building Decision Tree Classifiers:** Building decision tree classifiers using both Gini and Entropy criteria.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating the performance of the classifiers using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## Repository Structure
- `bank-full.csv`: Dataset containing information about marketing campaigns for a banking institution.
- `task_3_code.py`: Python script containing the code for Task 3.
- `README.md`: Readme file providing an overview of the repository.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies (`pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`).
3. Run the `task_3_code.py` script to execute the code.

## Dependencies
